###Explanation and Implementation of Pascal triangle 

To create a function that generates Pascal's Triangle based on this specified requirements, you can follow this structured approach using Python.
Here's a complete implementation of the `pascal_triangle(n)` function:

```python

### Refer to the Pascal triangle file for the code.


### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Check**: The function first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 0. If it is, an empty list is returned.

2. **Triangle Initialization**: The triangle is initialized with the first row, which contains a single `1`.

3. **Row Generation**:
    - A loop iterates from 1 to `n - 1`, creating each subsequent row.
    - Each new row starts with `1`.
    - The middle elements are calculated by summing the two elements directly above from the previous row.
    - Each row ends with another `1`.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the complete triangle as a list of lists.

### Example Output:
For `n = 5`, the output will be:
```
[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 3, 1],
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```

This function efficiently constructs Pascal's Triangle and meets all the specified requirements.
